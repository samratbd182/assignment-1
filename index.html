            <p>Union Minister Ramdas Athawale, whose ''Go Corona, Go'' chant became a national sensation, on Sunday came out with a new slogan, ''No Corona'', saying it was in response to the new strain of the novel coronavirus.</p>
            <p>"I gave the ''Go Corona Go'' slogan and the virus is now going. But it also came near me, leading to my hospitalisation (after testing COVID-19 positive). I thought coronavirus would not reach me but it can reach anywhere," Mr. Athawale said.</p>
            <p>"For the new coronavirus strain, I would say ''No Corona, No Corona'' as we don''t want either the old coronavirus or the new strain to infect us," he told reporters in Pune.</p>
